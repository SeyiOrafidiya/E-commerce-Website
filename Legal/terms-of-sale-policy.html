                            <p>We offer the “Verified by Visa” and “MasterCard SecureCode” service which provides you with a safer shopping experience when using your credit card online. You can register for the service when you reach the checkout process or by contacting your card issuer directly. 
                                This is a one off-registration process and you will be able to use the same password when making future purchases with us. Please note, dependent on your card issuer we may not be able to process your order if you do not register and a different method of payment may be required to complete your purchase.
                            <br></p>
                            <p>All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to, or does not for any reason, authorise payment then you will be notified as soon as possible.
                            <br></p>
                            <p>We may undertake searches with credit reference agencies for the purposes of verifying your identity and the personal information you submit as part of an order. To do so the agencies may check your personal information against any information on any database (public or otherwise) to which they have access. 
                                They may also use your details in the future to assist other companies for verification purposes. We may also use your personal information for the purposes of prevention or detection of fraud. By submitting your order, you agree to this.
                            <br></p>
                            <p>All Items ordered remain our property until we receive full payment from you.
